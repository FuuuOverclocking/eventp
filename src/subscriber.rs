//! [`Subscriber`] represents types that can be registered with an [`Eventp`](crate::Eventp)
//! to receive and handle I/O events.
//!
//! It is composed of 3 parts:
//!
//! - [`AsFd`] - Can borrow a file descriptor.
//! - [`HasInterest`] - Provides the interest in I/O readiness events for the fd, held in a `Cell`.
//! - [`Handler`] - Can handle the triggered events.
//!
//! You do not have to implement [`Subscriber`] manually. It is automatically implemented
//! for any type that implements these three traits.
//!
//! The **most common** approach is not to create a new type and implement them, but to start
//! a method chain with [`interest()`](crate::interest), which would be simpler and more
//! testable.
