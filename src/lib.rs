//! Safe Rust abstraction over Linux's `epoll`, offering a true zero-cost event dispatch mechanism.
//!
//! # Motivation
//!
//! `epoll` allows the user to associate a custom `u64` with a file descriptor (`fd`) when adding it.
//! This is intended to store the address of an event context object, but in Rust,
//! I've rarely seen it used correctly. Instead, it's often used to store things like the `fd`
//! itself, a `token` ([mio](https://docs.rs/mio/latest/mio/)), or a `subscriber id`
//! ([event_manager](https://docs.rs/event-manager/latest/event_manager/)).
//! This introduces unnecessary overhead of a branch instruction, or even one or two `HashMap` lookups.
//!
//! This is often due to the challenges of safely managing ownership and fat pointers in Rust when
//! interfacing with pointer-based C APIs. This crate aims to demonstrate how to leverage the Rust
//! type system to handle these issues safely and with zero cost, and how to use a few tricks to wrap
//! it all in a fluent, test-friendly API. See the [Technical](_technical) chapter for the principles
//! behind this approach.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! See a full example with a demo of writing unit tests on GitHub:
//! [examples/echo-server.rs](https://github.com/FuuuOverclocking/eventp/blob/main/examples/echo-server.rs).
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use std::io;
//! use eventp::{interest, tri_subscriber::WithHandler, Eventp, Subscriber};
//! use nix::sys::eventfd::EventFd;
//!
//! fn thread_main(eventfd: EventFd) -> io::Result<()> {
//!     let mut eventp = Eventp::default();
//!     interest()
//!         .read()
//!         .with_fd(eventfd)
//!         .with_handler(on_eventfd)
//!         .register_into(&mut eventp)?;
//!
//!     eventp.run_forever()
//! }
//!
//! fn on_eventfd(
//!     eventfd: &mut EventFd,
//!     // Other available parameters: Interest, Event, Pinned<'_, impl EventpOps>
//! ) {
//!     // do somethings...
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The `with_handler` method supports a form of dependency injection for the handler function.
//! You can define a handler that accepts only the parameters it needs, in any order. See the
//! [`tri_subscriber`] module for more details.
//!
//! # Concepts
//!
//! 1.  **The [`Eventp`] Reactor**: The central event loop that manages all I/O sources.
//! 2.  **The [`Subscriber`]**: A combination of an I/O source (anything that is [`AsFd`](std::os::fd::AsFd)),
//!     its event [`Interest`] (e.g., readable, writable), and a [`Handler`](subscriber::Handler) function.
//!     -   [`Interest`] vs [`Event`]: Both wrap [`EpollFlags`]. `Interest` is what you ask the OS to
//!         monitor (e.g., `EPOLLIN`). `Event` is what the OS reports back (e.g., `EPOLLIN | EPOLLHUP`).
//!         The two sets overlap but are not identical.
//!
//! ![subscriber-eventp-relationship](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FuuuOverclocking/eventp/refs/heads/main/docs/images/subscriber-eventp.svg)
//!
//! # Built-in Subscribers
//!
//! -   [`tri_subscriber`]: The helper subscriber constructed by the builder-like API starting from
//!     [`interest()`], where is the **recommended** API entry point.
//! -   `remote_endpoint` <span class="stab portability" title="Available on crate feature `remote-endpoint` only"><code>remote-endpoint</code></span>:
//!     A remote control for an `Eventp` instance running on another thread, allows sending closures
//!     to the `Eventp` thread to be executed.
//!
//! # Testability and Type Hierarchy
//!
//! ![type-hierarchy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FuuuOverclocking/eventp/refs/heads/main/docs/images/type-hierarchy.svg)
//!
//! To make unit testing easier, this crate provides [`MockEventp`], a mock implementation based on
//! [mockall], available under the <span class="stab portability" title="Available on crate feature `mock` only"><code>mock</code></span>
//! feature. Therefore, it's recommended to use the abstract [`EventpOps`] trait in function signatures.
//! This allows your code to accept both the real `Eventp` and `MockEventp`, making it highly testable.
//!
//! [`Pinned<'_, impl EventpOps>`](Pinned) is the handle passed to your handler when an event is triggered.
//! It acts like `&mut impl EventpOps` but prevents operations that could move the underlying Eventp
//! instance (like `std::mem::replace`), thus ensuring memory safety.
//!
//! The diagram also mentions [`EventpOpsAdd`]. You will rarely use this trait directly. It's a helper
//! trait that allows methods like `register_into()` to accept both types.
